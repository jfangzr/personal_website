					I have just launched (<Link href = "https://www.trialslookup.com">www.trialslookup.com</Link>), a LLM-based search engine for clinical trials. 
					The goal of this project is to help doctors and patients find clinical trials that are a match based on patient demographics, 
					conditions, and clinical phenotypes. This search engine is much faster and more precise than 
					the outdated <Link href = "https://www.clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</Link> website, which takes a long time to just query, a longer time to just 
					formulate the search, and much, much more time to sift through the clinical trials that are not a good fit for the patient. 
				</p>
				<p className="my-4">
					I am concurrently working on PrepStar AI (<Link href = "https://www.prepstar.io">www.prepstar.io</Link>), an interactive AI-based practice exam engine for students in high school. This 
					startup stems from my experiences studying for AP/IB exams in high school, where I really wished that there 
					were more practice materials that would&apos;ve saved me time. The practice exams are generated with state-of-the-art natural language processing 
					(NLP) models, calibrated at college-exam level or slightly harder to make sure students are prepared for exams.
				</p>
				<p className="my-4">
					I&apos;ve also been working on Bioimedge (pronounced bio-image), a zero- and low-code platform 
					for computer vision for biomedical and healthcare purposes. I envision this as a B2B startup
					working with doctors, researchers, and other businesses with needs for biomedical imaging. 
					I am looking for motivated, talented people to join as cofounder / engineeers.
