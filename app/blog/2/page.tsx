				<h1 className={title()}>2. Blessing from college rejections</h1>
				<h2 className={subtitle()}>UIUC was not my dream school. Going there was the best thing that has ever happened to me.</h2>
				<p className = "my-4">
					I stared at the time on my laptop, while 
					I was on a video call with my good friend Peter. <span className = "italic"> April 6, 2021, 19:00. </span> 
					Ivy Day decisions were to be released 
					at this moment. I had decided on the order that I will open the university decisions by the order 
					of ascending acceptance rate - Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Penn and Cornell. My rationale was 
					that any earlier rejections wouldn&apos;t dampen my hopes for following decision letters. Peter was there, 
					so that I wouldn&apos;t throw a screaming temper tantrum if the worst case happened: 6 stinky eggs out of 6.  
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Harvard. <span className = "italic">Reject.</span>
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Yale. <span className = "italic">Reject.</span>
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Princeton. <span className = "italic">Reject.</span>
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Columbia. <span className = "italic">Reject.</span>
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Penn. <span className = "italic">Reject.</span>
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Cornell. <span className = "italic">Reject.</span>
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					The worst case did happen. With the expectation to keep a face, instead I just sighed, and then discussed the acceptance offers
					that I have on hand: University of Waterloo Software Engineering, UIUC CS, UBC, University of Toronto,
					University of Pittsburgh and Penn State University. Narrowing the list down, I needed to break the tie 
					between UIUC CS and UW SE. We looked at new grad job/total compensation offer 
					statistics, then discussed school culture, and did some number-crunching on finances if I went to either school.
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Now holistic decisions fell on me to choose a school instead of the schools deciding 
					whether to admit me. The part that struck me was that UW SE was a 5-year program, for the sole purpose
					of funneling students into working SWE jobs in tech in Bay Area, Seattle or New York. UIUC, I figured
					at that time, that I could probably graduate in three years since I had a good amount of AP/IB credits
					coming in and it was a state school. I assumed career prospects would be similar graduating out of
					either school, but the two years that I could have work experience in would have been an opportunity 
					cost had I went to UW. Financially, UIUC was a sounder decision, especially given that I was expected
					to pay back my parents the money I use in university.. Around a week later, I committed to UIUC.  
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					<span className = "font-bold">On hindsight, my experiences told me I wouldn&apos;t have thrived more if I went elsewhere.</span> 
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					With a little bit of my rebellious self acting up, I started doing more research. I read the AP/IB 
					credit transfer pages and the graduate requirement pages religiously. I found out I had a lot of 
					credits already coming into UIUC since I did both AP/IB. By then, I already have credit for AP Chinese, 
					Biology, and Chemistry & IB Psychology SL. Furthermore, in senior year 
					I would be taking AP Calc BC & IB Math HL, Physics HL, 
					English HL, History HL, and French SL exams. I found out 
					that I could graduate within two years if I played my cards right.    
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Playing my cards right would have meant I needed to study and perform well on my senior-year AP/IB exams, 
					register for some community college courses, and then study and take proficiency exams to get out of intro-level courses and advance more quickly
					to deeper courses. Those deeper, more difficult courses were interesting to me and I wanted to take them faster. 
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Grabbing a Calc III textbook, I started studying multivariable calculus (MVC) concurrently as I studied for 
					IB exams. Most IB exams didn&apos;t fulfill particularly useful gen-ed requirements, although their credits 
					were great for getting the number of hours counted towards graduation hours (128 for engineering), so 
					I took more time for MVC and decided to gun for the June proficiency exam a week after graduation. 
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Concurrently, I registered for 4 general education classes at Community College of Allegheny
					County (CCAC). These were online classes: Micro- and Macroeconomics, African American History, 
					Intro Anthropology. They took not much time in the summer, and I did that while studying for further 
					proficiency exams at the beginning of the fall semester.
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					In the fall, I passed all of my proficiency exams. My fast-track graduation plan is falling into place.
					In my first semester, I was already taking 300- and 400-level classes, although these were the easier
					of the classes - still in the required curriculum. In my second semester, I was already taking
					classes for graduate credit. 
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					But the biggest positive change I had in college is finding my outgoing self, and then forming 
					wonderful, lifelong friends. I did a great deal of things that high-school me would have never
					thought I would have the time to do just in my first year of university at UIUC: 
				</p>
				<ul className="list-disc list-inside indent-4 my-4">
					<li>Playing piano blindfolded in Allen Hall dorm performing arts showcases</li>
					<li>Going to Model UN and VR club</li>
					<li>Travelling for a Model UN conference in Los Angeles</li>
					<li>See concerts at Krannert</li>
					<li>Go vinyl hunting with friends</li>
					<li>Play piano for an architecture gala fundraiser</li>
					<li>Having had a first (and quite happy) romantic relationship</li>
					<li>Doing research in second semester that resulted in a conference presentation</li>
				</ul>
				<p className = "my-4">
					I did a summer semester, completing two more courses taken for graduate credit. 
					Then I had the good fortune of studying abroad for much of my second year, in Lausanne, Switzerland. 
					I used EPFL classes to fulfill my remaining requirements in the fall, such that I can have half of spring semester 
					dedicated to travelling around Europe. I learned to figure out life by myself, doing more chores, and improved my 
					French significantly as well. If I went to another university, I don&apos;t think I could have studied 
					abroad and knocked out my remaining graduation requirements by the spring semester, leaving me 
					with a lot of time to pursue whatever I wanted to pursue. 
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					And all of this was while saving my parents (and future me) over $150k in cost of attendance. 
					The total cost of my studies, including study abroad and three semesters, was around $90k. It was not
					a small amount, but even compared to 3 or 4 years of in-state students, I was saving substantial 
					amounts on college and done university by 19. Had I gone to a private school, my degree&apos;s price tag
					would have came out to $320k. And I might have drowned in the competition with other fantastic students,
					instead of letting myself develop personally, be happy, and have my degree by 19. 
				</p>
				<p className = "my-4">
					Now I am not saying that I wouldn&apos;t have found fantastic opportunities had I went to another 
					institution. But the unique environment at UIUC allowed me to thrive and accomplish what I did. 
					The biggest takeaway I want to give is that you never know the pots of gold that would find 
					if you choose to embrace the opportunities you&apos;re given, instead of looking at the past with sorrow.
